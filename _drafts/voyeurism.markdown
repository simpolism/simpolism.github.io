## What Is Voyeurism?

The act of voyeurism, in its most idealized form, is an asymmetric interaction between two individuals:
* a _voyeur_, the hidden observer, often male, and
* a _target_, the oblivious exhibit, often female

Voyeurism is asymmetric: the voyeur is hidden, yet he is observing the target perform _some action_. The target's actions typically involve a _taboo_ or _dignity violation_. Haley Thurston writes, in her essay ["The Heroine's Journey"](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2015/01/28/the-heroines-journey/) (emphasis mine):

> If the graceful negotiation of composure and things that threaten composure is the essence of female value, and fetishes originate in the secret and taboo, then well, of course **the destruction of female composure would become deeply, repeatedly fetishized.**

The voyeur attempts to catch the target in a moment in which her composure is compromised, such as while undressed. The process of positioning and anticipating a target is rich with erotic tension. It is also deeply male: voyeurism is applied problem-solving, an objectification of a target for the voyeur's sexual pleasure. The target is an animal, and the voyeur is laying a trap.

Space matters to the peeping tom. Voyeurism involves violating a target's _expectation of privacy_. Enclosed spaces, such as changing rooms and bathrooms, are the most obvious locations, as they exist explicitly for the purpose of privacy. Voyeurism is not limited to private spaces, though: it can occur in public spaces, such as parks or Instagram timelines, where it is known as _creeping_.

A key emotion for the voyeur is _anxiety_. Violating any taboo carries risk, and voyeurism is one of the riskiest taboos to violate: privacy is treated almost as seriously as bodily autonomy. A pervert is on the same plane as a rapist. However, anxiety goes hand-in-hand with the erotic. Perhaps "voyeurism" exists as a distinct erotic category only because it is taboo. If individuals had no expectation of privacy, the appeal might disappear.

Once a target is "caught", she might or might not be aware of the voyeur. This leads to different fantastical scenarios with different erotic outcomes. We will explore the following scenarios, in which the target becomes aware of the voyeur to various degrees:

1. total or partial unawareness of the voyeur (the _hidden_ case)
2. awareness of the voyeur, accompanied by arousal and increased performativity (the _exhibition_ case)
3. awareness of the voyeur, accompanied by shame and attempted evasion (the _shame_ case)

## The Hidden Case

To discuss these possibilites, I pull upon Thomas Nagel's [Sexual Perversions](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bc66/32ba46b9d31b0bff5285ebe8c1453513cce2.pdf) (pdf), specifically his "cocktail lounge" thought experiment. Please allow me to quote Nagel at length, explaining the "normal" process of arousal in a _symmetric_ observational situation:

> Suppose a man and a woman, whom we may call Romeo and Juliet, are at opposite ends of a cocktail lounge, with many mirrors on the walls which permit unobserved observation, and even mutual unobserved observation. Each of them is sipping a martini and studying other people in the mirrors. At some point Romeo notices Juliet. He is moved, somehow, by the softness of her hair and the diffidence with which she sips her martini, and this arouses him sexually. Let us say that X senses Y whenever X regards Y with sexual desire. (Y need not be a person, and X's apprehension of Y can be visual, tactile, olfactory, etc., or purely imaginary; in the present example we shall concentrate on vision.)

> So Romeo senses Juliet, rather than merely noticing her. At this stage he is aroused by an unaroused object, so he is more in the sexual grip of his body than she of hers.

Here we see the _hidden_ case as described above: the voyeur is aware of the target, but she is not aware of him. We might visualize this as follows:

![hidden voyeur case](https://github.com/simpolism/simpolism.github.io/blob/master/assets/voyeurism_hidden.jpg)

Much voyeurism stops here. Ironically, the voyeur's safety in these situations relies on safeguarding _his own privacy_, exactly the thing he is stripping from his target.

## The Exhibition Case

Further possibilities emerge as the target gains more knowledge of the situation:

> Let us suppose, however, that Juliet now senses Romeo in another mirror on the opposite wall, though neither of them yet knows that he is seen by the other (the mirror angles provide three-quarter views). Romeo then begins to notice in Juliet the subtle signs of sexual arousal: heavy-lidded stare, dilating pupils, faint flush, et cetera. This of course renders her much more bodily, and he not only notices but senses this as well. His arousal is nevertheless still solitary. But now, cleverly calculating the line of her stare without actually looking her in the eyes, he realizes that it is directed at him through the mirror on the opposite wall. That is, he notices, and moreover senses, Juliet sensing him. This is definitely a new development, for it gives him a sense of embodiment not only through his own reactions but through the eyes and reactions of another. Moreover, it is separable from the initial sensing of Juliet; for sexual arousal might begin with a person's sensing that he is sensed and being assailed by the perception of the other person's desire rather than merely by the perception of the person.

> But there is a further step. Let us suppose that Juliet, who is a little slower than Romeo, now senses that he senses her. This puts Romeo in a position to notice, and be aroused by, her arousal at being sensed by him. He senses that she senses that he senses her. This is still another level of arousal, for he becomes conscious of his sexuality through his awareness of its effect on her and of her awareness that this effect is due to him. Once she takes the same step and senses that he senses her sensing him, it becomes difficult to state, let alone imagine, further iterations, though they may be logically distinct. If both are alone, they will presumably turn to look at each other directly, and the proceedings will continue on another plane. Physical contact and intercourse are perfectly natural extensions of this complicated visual exchange, and mutual touch can involve all the complexities of awareness present in the visual case, but with a far greater range of subtlety and acuteness.

We might visualize this "normal" erotic encounter as follows:

![Nagel's cocktail party](https://github.com/simpolism/simpolism.github.io/blob/master/assets/voyeurism_nagel_arousal.jpg)

The voyeuristic encounter begins to diverge from Nagel's idealized account on one specific detail (emphasis mine): "_sexual arousal might begin with a person's sensing that he is sensed and being assailed by the perception of **the other person's desire** rather than merely by the perception of the person_". In an _exhibition_ situation, the voyeur is physically aware of the target, but the target's desire is _formless_: the target does not desire _the voyeur_, as a body or as a whole person, she instead desires exhibition, _to be seen_, with the voyeur validating this fantasy.

The exhibitionist fantasy springs from a similar place to the voyeuristic fantasy. The exhibitionist fantasizes about violating the same privacy norms as the voyeur, but in the first-person as opposed to the third-person. The interaction between a voyeur and an exhibitionist might exhibit these characteristics:

* In her awareness of being observed, the exhibitionist is having her fantasy fulfilled.
* By acting plausibly as if she were unaware of the voyeur, and continuing to degrade herself, the exhbitionist fulfills the voyeur's fantasy.
* By tacitly ackowledging her awareness, the voyeur _knows that the exhibitionist knows_, and this dramatically heightens his arousal.
* Ideally, the voyeur somehow signals to the exhibitionist that he knows she knows, but the idealized voyeur is silent and perfectly hidden. Despite receiving no signals from the voyeur, the exhibitionist might fantasize about his increased sexual excitement, and he might imagine her fantasizing about him.

We might visualize this encouter as follows:

![exhibitionist case](https://github.com/simpolism/simpolism.github.io/blob/master/assets/voyeurism_exhibition.jpg)

Exhibitionism is an ideal pairing with voyeurism. It is reciprocated to a large degree and involves mutual fulfillment of fantasy. It involves elements close to what Nagel calls "the basic framework of any full-fledged sexual relation". Nagel might still describe a voyeur-exhibitionist pairing as a perversion, though, as it still involves a "truncated or incomplete [version] of the complete configuration" described above. According to Nagel, once a sexual encounter involves imagining a partner's response rather than observing it, the encounter becomes perverse.

Unfortunately for the enterprising voyeur, it is difficult to know whether his target will be an exhibitionist. The target's emotions are likely to be mixed between arousal and shame, and many individuals will choose to act on their feelings of shame rather than "leaning into" the arousal.

We might ask the question: what makes an exhibitionist? What might cause one to choose to give into the arousal rather than the shame? A monologue from Ingmar Bergman's film _Persona_ might reveal this dynamic to us more clearly:

> We lay there completely naked and sunbathed... dozing off and on, putting sunscreen on. We had silly straw hats on. Mine had a blue ribbon. I lay there...looking out at the landscape, at the sea and the sun. It was kind of funny. Suddenly I saw two figures on the rocks above us. They hid and peeped out occasionally. "Two boys are looking at us," I said to the girl, Her name was Katarina. "Let them look," she said, and turned over on her back. I had a funny feeling. I wanted to jump up and put my suit on, but I just lay there on my stomach with my bottom in the air, unembarrassed, totally calm. And Katarina was next to me with her breasts and big thighs. She was just giggling. I noticed that the boys were coming closer. They just stood there looking at us. I noticed they were very young. The boldest one approached us...and squatted down next to Katarina. He pretended to be busy picking his toes. I felt very strange. Suddenly Katarina said to him, "Hey, you, why don't you come over here?" Then she took his hand and helped him take off his jeans and shirt. Suddenly he was on top of her...

The [monologue continues in more graphic detail](http://www.actorpoint.com/free_monologues/mvw112.html), but the most important aspects have been revealed:

* The voyeurs are naive, young, presumably peeking due to honest curiosity.
* The exhibitionists are in a secure and dominant position.
* The "funny feeling" and desire to flee means anxiety (but anxiety and eroticism go hand-in-hand).

From these observations we can intuit that exhibitionism involves an explicit power dynamic: the exhibitionist has power over the voyeur. He desires her, and she knows it. She could report him to the authorities, or she could fulfill his desires, and he knows it. A naive voyeur has a stronger desire, and presents less of a threat if he decides to overstep whatever boundaries the exhibitionist sets.

Thus, a naive or weak voyeur is more likely to provoke an exhibitionistic response. Perhaps the exhibitionist impulse ties into the mothering impulse rather than the submissive impulse typically ascribed to women's sexuality: the child desires the mother, and the mother wants to fulfill his desires.

## The Shame Case

Given the uncertainty about whether a voyeur's actions will be met with arousal or shame, it makes sense that some voyeuristic fantasies explicitly involve triggering a shame response. In the _shame_ situation, the voyeur obtains pleasure from the target's distress. This can be likened to Nagel's discussion of sadism:

> Sadism concentrates on the evocation of passive self-awareness in others, but the sadist's engagement is itself active and requires a retention of deliberate control which impedes awareness of himself as a bodily subject of passion in the required sense. The victim must recognize him as the source of his own sexual passivity, but only as the active source. De Sade claimed that the object of sexual desire was to evoke involuntary responses from one's partner, especially audible ones. The infliction of pain is no doubt the most efficient way to accomplish this...

In voyeurism as opposed to physical domination, pain is replaced by _intimate knowledge_, an intrusion into the target's sphere of assumed privacy. The voyeur causes the target to act out of shame, thus demonstrating his power over her and satisfying De Sade's criterion. In literature, this situation is often a precursor to direct physical domination of the target. We might visualize this as follows:

## Conclusion

The following diagram summarizes all discussed cases:

![voyeurism summary](https://github.com/simpolism/simpolism.github.io/blob/master/assets/voyeurism_full.jpg)

To summarize, voyeurism is a sexual fantasy rooted in the privacy taboo, paralleled by exhibitionism. This begs the question: why might someone prefer voyeurism over a typical sexual encounter?

The voyeur violates his target's privacy without consent, and he leaves no trace if his attempt is successful. Most sexual encounters involve a consensual relaxation of privacy--couples often view each other naked--but voyeurism is attractive if no mutual relation seems possible. A successful voyeur is freed from both consequences and from the social games involved in finding a partner. Perhaps this is why the dorky kid is often cast as a pervert: voyeurism allows the dork to pursue his erotic desires in a concrete manner, no matter how unappealing he might be.

Porn also has a deep relationship to voyeurism. The act of viewing porn is analogous to an act of voyeurism: an observer witnesses some situation and becomes aroused. As a result, voyeurism might have special appeal to avid porn consumers: porn feeds our fantasies, and all porn is voyeuristic to some degree. We might be tempted to claim that voyeurism is an attempt to _act out the experience of watching porn_, or even the experience of watching any visual media including TV. But, [David Foster Wallace disagrees](https://jsomers.net/DFW_TV.pdf) (pdf):

> ...a lot of the criticism [of TV], the really rabid criticism less leveled than sprayed at networks, advertisers, and audiences alike, has to do with the charge that television has turned us into a nation of sweaty, slack-jawed voyeurs. This charge turns out to be untrue, but for weird reasons.

> What classic voyeurism is is espial: watching people who don't know you're there as they go about the mundane but erotically charged little businesses of private life. It's interesting that so much classic voyeurism involves media of framed glass--windows, telescopes, etc. Maybe the framed glass is why the analogy to television is so tempting. But TV-watching is a different animal from Peeping Tomism. Because the people we're watching through TV's framed-glass screen are not really ignorant of the fact that somebody is watching them...

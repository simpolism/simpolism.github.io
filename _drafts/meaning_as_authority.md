# Meaning As Authority

### I. What is meaning?

What is meaning, the experience of meaningfulness? And how do I know what is worth doing, what actions will provide me meaning?

Toby Shorin describes "meaning" as "an evolutionarily evolved mechanic in our brains that helps us to decide what’s important, to negotiate and cooperate, and to motivate to get things done."<sup>[1](#1)</sup> This is useful as a first step, but reveals little about "meaning" on a personal or experiential level.

In "A Nihilist's Guide to Meaning"<sup>[2](#2)</sup>, Simler attempts to discuss our perception of meaning by claiming "a thing X will be perceived as meaningful in context C to the extent that it's connected to other meaningful things in C." He elaborates:

> note the recursion: the meaning of a thing is defined by its connections to other meaningful things. This may seem circular or question-begging, but I think that's precisely the point. Few things are meaningful all by themselves; most derive their meaning from the things they point to. Of course, the buck has to stop somewhere, at some source of inherent or axiomatic meaning. In a religious context, for example, God is the ultimate arbiter of what is or isn't meaningful. Meanwhile, in secular contexts, most people seem happy to accept the premise that human life is inherently meaningful (or something along those lines). Those who insist on pressing further — e.g., by asking why human life is meaningful — must then gaze into the dark abyss.

Why is human life meaningful? Where do these fabled sources of "axiomatic meaning" come from? Let us gaze into the abyss.

### II. Axiomatic Meaning as Authority

As Simler rightly notes, every action one takes feels meaningful in relation to its context. We wake up in the morning, we shower, and we go to work, mostly without thinking about it. These actions are meaningful because the axiomatic meaning in this context is meaningful: everything you need to do before going to work matters, because going to work matters. But we can peel away another layer: why does going to work matter?

Most might answer this in a variety of ways: "because I need money," "because it matters to me that I don't upset my boss," "because my work helps people," "because I enjoy my job." For each of these, we can keep asking "why?" until an axiom is reached. Typically these axioms will break down into a couple of distinct categories, which I call the "authorities":

* physiology: "I did it because I was hungry and desperate"
* tradition: "I did it because I have always done it"
* individuals: "I did it because my boss told me to"
* values: "I did it because it is good"
* institutions: "I did it because the group or system required it"
* the self: "I did it because it is a part of who I am"

Note that each authority can be justified in terms of any other. However, when we _make decisions_, we typically will make them in service of particular authorities. This is fundamental: decision-making is when choices "feeling meaningful" matters most. Julian Jaynes, in his book "The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind," argues that:

> It has now been clearly established that decision-making... is precisely what stress is. If rats have to cross an electric grid each time they wish to get food and water, such rats develop ulcers. Just shocking the rats does not do this to them. There has to be a pause of conflict or the decision-making stress of whether to cross a grid or not to produce this effect.<sup>[3](#3)</sup>

If we recognize that we must make a decision, it is due to a conflict between authorities. A decision with no conflict between authorities will not feel like a decision at all. In this case, the rats had a conflict between two physiological authorities -- the desire to eat, and the desire to avoid pain -- which caused them significant physiological stress. The same goes for humans; it is known as "the paradox of choice." We might argue that the experience of meaning is identical to the experience of carrying out task commanded by a particularly powerful authority. We might even call these authorities "gods".

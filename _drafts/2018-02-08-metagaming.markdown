A little writing I did in a Facebook group, posted in reply to the following:

> Wikipedia defines “metagaming” this way: “_Metagaming is any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game._”

> Okay, so if I’m the coach of a baseball team and I see the opposing team send up a left handed batter, and I sub out my right handed pitcher for a left handed pitcher (because I believe some old wive’s tale about handedness and batters/pitchers), does that qualify as “playing the game of baseball in the position of coach” or “metagaming”?

## I.

Taking cues from postmodernism [specifically, drawing on Lyotard’s usage of “game”<sup>[1](#f1)</sup>, drawn originally from Wittgenstein], you are actually discussing two separate games: “baseball”, a formal “closed” game, and “Professional Baseball” (I’ll call it “pball”), an informal “open” game that interacts with baseball.

Both games have rules, the difference is that baseball’s rules are written down in a rulebook, whereas pball’s rules are informal, decided by consensus: it is known what “sorts of metagaming” are acceptable and what sorts are not (e.g. it’s known to be okay to hold a player on the bench if he needs to be rested for a more important game next week). These are the rules of pball. They are decided collectively, by the players themselves (and perhaps even partly by the audience). The players of pball are the coaches, the owners of the team, and other people involved in the professional sport.

We call these rules “metagaming” because they are “beyond” baseball, but really pball is an entirely different game with different objectives, and the game of baseball merely has a large interaction with its rules. The two are not independent, though: pball can change the formal rules of baseball, and formal rule changes in baseball can change the rules of pball. In that sense, we could describe them “symbiotic” games.

Some people like watching baseball (I find it kinda dry), and others such as [question-asker] like watching pball. These games have quite different sets of rules and victory conditions, thus they are appealing in quite different ways.

## II.

To be clear, each professional game has its own variety of “pball” involving the rules for how the leagues and “overarching” victory conditions work. But we could even abstract a level further to “meta-pball”, in which various sorts of professional sports compete or cooperate with each other for dominance of TV time and their audience’s attention.

“Meta-pball” might involve, say, deciding which season the sport will be played in. Its actual players are odd objects: teams comprised of cooperating team owners and media personnel. You could even argue that each player of meta-pball is itself a professional sports league.

Its rules filter down to pball as well: the sorts of decisions you’re allowed to make in pball (such as whether to reserve a player or not) are partly determined by considerations of how this rule might help the professional game compete for audience attention vs other games. This game is also where the Real money lives, perhaps because it exists more closely to “the money game” of American culture<sup>[2](#f2)</sup>…

**Footnotes:**

<a name="f1">1</a>. Lyotard discussed the concept of “game” in his book _The Postmodern Condition_, although he was primarily using the concept of “language games” which are a bit more specific than the concept of game I describe here.

<a name="f2">2</a>. I’m drawing the idea of “the money game” from Gwern’s essay [“The Melancholy of Subculture Society”](https://www.gwern.net/The-Melancholy-of-Subculture-Society), in which Gwern presents the idea of a “worldwide culture” based on money with subcultures existing beside it. It seems to me that these subcultures structure hierarchically based on size or other difficulty factors, thus a more “meta” game affecting more people would be closer to the “worldwide” game of money acquisition. Working from another line of reasoning, it is also probable that the sum of all sports competition would have more money at stake than a single sport.

> In the beginning, there was Jack, and Jack had a groove.  
> And from this groove came the groove of all grooves.  
> And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldy declared,  
> "Let there be HOUSE!" and house music was born.

> I am, you see, I am the creator, and this is my house!  
> And, in my house there is only house music.  
> But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then becomes OUR house and OUR house music!  
> And, you see, no one man owns house because house music is a universal language, spoken and understood by all.

_\- from ["My House" acapella](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO9KEKnnlKs) as popularized [above many tunes](http://hyperreal.org/raves/spirit/vibe/JacksHouse.html) but most famously atop [Mr Fingers' "Can You Feel It?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ts8iBs3tpmw)._

Music criticism has eluded me lately. I don't know how to write about the music I like: electronic dance music. I could write about albums, but it doesn't feel right. What albums could I discuss? The disposable sets I find on Mixcloud? There seems to be a fundamental divergence between how I engage with the music I like, and how critics of the past thought about music.

To try and understand, we'll have to first look backwards. We can look at [Lester Bangs writing about Astral Weeks](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/murray.wood/astral.html) and note how he attacks the album in question:

* He writes about his own life and connection to the album: "fall of 1968 was such a terrible time".
* He relates the album to a broader context, contrasting with other albums and other artists: "but like the later albums by the Velvet Underground, there was a redemptive element".
* He writes about the artist's other performances: "1974, a late night network TV rock concert".
* He analyzes the formal structure of the artist's performance: "four rushed repeats of the phrases 'you breathe in, you breath out' and 'you turn around'".
* He performs an analysis of the artist's intent and "mental processes": "Van Morrison is interested, obsessed with how much musical or verbal information he can compress into a small space".
* He analyzes the lyrics and what messages it carries and how they relate to the musical performance: "in 'T.B. Sheets', his last extended narrative before making this record, Van Morrison watched a girl he loved die of tuberculosis. the song was claustrophobic, suffocating, mostrously powerful"
* He attempts to draw broader philosophical truths that he sees within the work: "maybe what [Astral Weeks] boil[s] down to is one moment's knowledge of the miracle of life, with its inevitable concomitant, a vertiginous glimpse of the capacity to be hurt, and the capacity to inflict that hurt."
* He draws a narrative arc of the artist and discusses how the album fits within it: "no wonder, too, that Van Morrison never came this close to looking life square in the face again"
* Interleaved in all the above is _feeling_: _emotions_ and _thoughts_ relating to the work, using quite poetic language.

It's a brilliant essay, the sort of thing that leaves a permanent mark on readers when they discover it, that leads them to reinterpret the work in question and perhaps attempt deeper understandings of other works they might have felt but never _fully interpreted_. And it would be impossible to write this sort of essay about dance music.

Dance music brings into question the concept of "the artist" who makes "an album". Creation works differently: parades of anonymous producers release a couple of singles each, and pseudo-anonymous DJs collect these and weave sets. There is no artist with vision, there is no masterpiece album that acts as a focal point, only a dance between music made and music available, singles and mixes, both important, neither the final word. Is the DJ the artist, is the DJ mix the album? The DJ is a curator, arranging singles in a pleasing order. The DJ mix is like a gallery show. Is the producer, the person crystallizing the music itself, the artist? Perhaps, but he is also absent, intentionless, his 10 minutes of music cannot stand alone. Intentionality is distributed in dance music. How can you critique an absent artist? How do you write about dance music?

We can consider some options:
1. The artist is the producer and the album is the single.
1. The artist is the DJ and the album is the DJ mix.
1. The artist is the gestalt of the producer/DJ/crowd and the album is the performance itself.
1. The artist is distributed feedback loops of intentionality and the album is the sum of works, including both singles and mixes, within the "artist's" genre or scene.

While (3) still applies to critique of live shows, it seems clear to me that (4) comes closer to the true nature of dance music. We can see that, rather than emerging from a single mind, dance music emerges from a _place_, either real or virtual (but usually real, as virtual parties are unsatisfyingly non-physical). Dance music's design and intent is _embedded within the social fabric_ of the area from which it emerges, thus we must discuss factors such as: communication channels, physical spaces, technology, cultural attitudes, institutions, and so on. Dance music must be analyzed _anthropologically_ rather than _intentionally_, with the curious caveat that the author must still incorporate the music's formal structure and communicate _feeling_.

This difference appears in the media. The year 2000 film _Groove_ follows several personal narratives as they interact at a rave party. The movie is about the music interacting with their lives. The TV documentary [_Pump Up The Volume_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rw-tRL9PUNg) interviews key DJs and producers involved in the 80s house music scene. They don't usually discuss artists, instead they talk about radio shows, nightclubs and their curators, their experiences, and maybe _that one single_ that inspired them. The figures might discuss a singular artist, such as Larry Levan, but it's clear that his artistry wasn't _imbued within the music_, but instead _within the culture itself_: they talk about how he maintained his Meatpacking District nightclub, The Paradise Garage, obsessively calibrating the homemade speakers. They talked about his _presence_ as a DJ and how the dancefloor interacted with him, how he'd play the same song four times over the course of an evening and tease the dancers. Levan was a cultural elder within his musical sphere: to discuss his music would necessarily involve discussing the entire context that made it possible.

And so we can see why dance music discussion often involves hyper-hyper-subgenres: because each of those subsubgenres, each of those physical scenes that established an idiosyncratic culture and sound, are themselves analogous to _a single great work_ within rock music. The single or the DJ mix might be the mediums through which people consume music, but in dance music _criticism_, the _subgenre is the album_, and the _scene is the artist_. This explains some of the ire associated with certain producers: when Pitchfork reviews a James Blake album, it can immediately be recognized as a _crossover_ attempt, certain aesthetic trappings of dance music crossing into the album-oriented rock music form.

The rise of Youtube and Soundcloud and even Spotify has had a domain-shifting effect. Music now looks like dance music always had: a distributed collection of one-offs existing within an essential cultural context. Thus, these conceptual and critical differences are becoming more relevant than ever before. We are beyond "remix culture" and have entered a truly distributed creative environment. Hopefully, an understanding of these dynamics can provide us guidance in building a critical history of music as time and technology continue their steady march.

The artist is dead, and may the album rest in peace by his side.

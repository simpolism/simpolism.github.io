Lakoff in [The Contemporary Theory of Metaphor](https://www.are.na/block/2554310) (1992):

> **The Nature of Metaphor**  
> • Metaphor is the main mechanism through which we comprehend abstract concepts and perform abstract reasoning.  
> • Much subject matter, from the most mundane to the most abstruse scientific theories, can only be comprehended via metaphor.  
> • Metaphor is fundamentally conceptual, not linguistic, in nature.  
> • Metaphorical language is a surface manifestation of conceptual metaphor.  
> • Though much of our conceptual system is metaphorical, a significant part of it is nonmetaphorical. Metaphorical understanding is grounded in nonmetaphorical understanding.  
> • Metaphor allows us to understand a relatively abstract or inherently unstructured subject matter in terms of a more concrete, or at least a more highly structured subject matter.

> **The Structure of Metaphor**  
> • Metaphors are mappings across conceptual domains.  
> • Such mappings are asymmetric and partial.  
> • Each mapping is a fixed set of ontological correspondences between entities in a source domain and entities in a target domain.  
> • When those fixed correspondences are activated, mappings can project source domain inference patterns onto target domain inference patterns.  
> • Metaphorical mappings obey the Invariance Principle: The image-schema structure of the source domain is projected onto the target domain in a way that is consistent with inherent target domain structure.  
> • Mappings are not arbitrary, but grounded in the body and in everyday experience and knowledge.  
> • A conceptual system contains thousands of conventional metaphorical mappings, which form a highly structured subsystem of the conceptual system.  
> • There are two types of mappings: conceptual mappings and imagemappings; both obey the Invariance Principle.

> **Some Aspects of Metaphor**  
> • The system of conventional conceptual metaphor is mostly unconscious, automatic, and is used with no noticeable effort, just like our linguistic system and the rest of our conceptual system.  
> • Our system of conventional metaphor is alive in the same sense that our system of grammatical and phonological rules is alive; namely, it is constantly in use, automatically and below the level of consciousness.  
> • Our metaphor system is central to our understanding of experience and to the way we act on that understanding.  
> • Conventional mappings are static correspondences, and are not, in themselves, algorithmic in nature. However, this by no means rules out the possibility that such static correspondences might be used in language processing that involves sequential steps.  
> • Metaphor is mostly based on correspondences in our experiences, rather than on similarity.  
> • The metaphor system plays a major role in both the grammar and lexicon of a language.  
> • Metaphorical mappings vary in universality; some seem to be universal, others are widespread, and some seem to be culture-specific.  
> • Poetic metaphor is, for the most part, an extension of our everyday, conventional system of metaphorical thought

Similar to Lakoff is Jaynes' definition of metaphor, from [_The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind_](https://www.are.na/block/2554290) (1976):

> I am using metaphor here in its most general sense: the use of a term for one thing to describe another beacuse of some kind of similarity between them or between their relations to other things. There are thus always two terms in a metaphor, the thing to be described, which I shall call the _metaphrand_, and the thing or relation used to elucidate it, which I shall call the _metaphier_. A metaphor is always a known metaphier operating on a less known metaphrand. I have coined these hybrid terms simply to echo muliplication where a multiplier operates on a multiplicand. (48-49)

> If we look more carefully at the nature of metaphor (noticing all the while the metaphorical nature of almost everything we are saying), we find (even the verb "find"!) that it is composed of more than a metaphier and a metaphrand. There are also at the bottom of the most complex metaphors various associations or attributes of the metaphier which I am going to call _paraphiers_. And these paraphiers project back into the metaphrand as what I shall call _paraphrands_ of the metaphrand. (56)

Jaynes elaborates on the function of metaphor (emphasis mine):

> It is by metaphor that language grows. The common reply to the question "what is it?" is, when the reply is difficult or the experience unique, "well, it is like ---." In laboratory studies, both children and adults describing nonsense objects (or metaphrands) to others who cannot see them use extended metaphiers that with repetition become contracted into labels. This is the major way in which the vocabulary of language is formed. **The grand and vigorous function of metaphor is the generation of new language as it is needed, as human culture becomes more and more complex**. (Jaynes 49)

> \[Consider\] the _arm_ of a chair or the sea; the _leg_ of a table, compass, sailor's voyage, or cricket field; and so on and on. Or the _foot_ of this page. Or the _leaf_ you will soon turn. All of these concrete metaphors increase enormously our powers of perception of the world about us and our understanding of it, and literally create new objects. Indeed, **language is an organ of perception, not simply a means of communication**. (Jaynes 49-50)

> This is language moving out synchronically (or without reference to time) into the space of the world to describe it and perceive it more and more definitively. But language also moves in another and more important way, diachronically, or through time, and behind our experiences on the basis of aptic structures in our nervous systems to create abstract concepts whose referents are not observables except in a metaphorical sense. And these too are generated by metaphor. This is indeed the nub (knob), heart, pith, kernel, core, marrow, etc. of my argument, which itself is a metaphor and 'seen' only with the mind's 'eye'. (Jaynes 50)

> In early times, language and its referents climbed up from the concrete to the abstract on the steps of metaphors, even, we may say, created the abstract on the bases of metaphors. (Jaynes 51)

> It is not always obvious that metaphor has played this all-important function. But this is because the concrete metaphiers become hidden in phonemic change, leaving the words to exist on their own. Even such an unmetaphorical-sounding word as the verb 'to be' was generated from a metaphor. It comes from the Sanskrit _bhu_, "to grow, or make grow," while the English forms 'am' and 'is' have evolved from the same root as the Sanskrit _asmi_, "to breathe." It is something of a lovely surprise that the irregular conjugation of our most nondescript verb is thus a record of a time when man had no independent word for 'existence' and could only say that something 'grows' or that it "breathes."... **Abstract words are ancient coins whose concrete images in the busy give-and-take of talk have worn away with use.** (Jaynes 51)

### <a name="orwell">Orwell</a>

Compare the metaphor of "abstract words as ancient coins wearing away" to a passage from [Orwell's "Politics and the English Language"](https://www.are.na/block/2555065) (1946):

> DYING METAPHORS. A newly invented metaphor assists thought by evoking a visual image, while on the other hand a metaphor which is technically ‘dead’ (e. g. iron resolution) has in effect reverted to being an ordinary word and can generally be used without loss of vividness. But in between these two classes there is a huge dump of worn-out metaphors which have lost all evocative power and are merely used because they save people the trouble of inventing phrases for themselves. Examples are: Ring the changes on, take up the cudgel for, toe the line, ride roughshod over, stand shoulder to shoulder with, play into the hands of, no axe to grind, grist to the mill, fishing in troubled waters, on the order of the day, Achilles’ heel, swan song, hotbed. Many of these are used without knowledge of their meaning (what is a ‘rift’, for instance?), and incompatible metaphors are frequently mixed, a sure sign that the writer is not interested in what he is saying. Some metaphors now current have been twisted out of their original meaning without those who use them even being aware of the fact. For example, toe the line is sometimes written as tow the line. Another example is the hammer and the anvil, now always used with the implication that the anvil gets the worst of it. In real life it is always the anvil that breaks the hammer, never the other way about: a writer who stopped to think what he was saying would avoid perverting the original phrase. (Orwell 130)

### <a name="nietzsche">Nietzsche: Metaphor and Truth</a>

Nietzsche writes in [On Truth and Lies in the Nonmoral Sense](https://www.are.na/block/2554307) (1873) (emphasis mine):

> ...a nerve stimulus is transferred into an image: first metaphor. The image, in turn, is imitated in a sound: second metaphor. And each time there is a complete overleaping of one sphere, right into the middle of an entirely new and different one.

> It is this way with all of us concerning language; we believe that we know something about the things themselves when we speak of trees, colors, snow, and flowers; and yet we possess nothing but metaphors for things--metaphors which correspond in no way to the original entities...  In particular, let us further consider the formation of concepts. Every word instantly becomes a concept precisely insofar as it is not supposed to serve as a reminder of the unique and entirely individual original experience to which it owes its origin; but rather, a word becomes a concept insofar as it simultaneously has to fit countless more or less similar cases... Just as it is certain that one leaf is never totally the same as another, so it is certain that the concept "leaf" is formed by arbitrarily discarding these individual differences and by forgetting the distinguishing aspects...

> What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and; anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding. **Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions- they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost their embossing and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins**...

> At bottom, what the investigator of such truths is seeking is only the metamorphosis of the world into man. He strives to understand the world as something analogous to man, and at best he achieves by his struggles the feeling of assimilation. Similar to the way in which astrologers considered the stars to be in man's service and connected with his happiness and sorrow, such an investigator considers the entire universe in connection with man... He forgets that the original perceptual metaphors are metaphors and takes them to be the things themselves...

> If but for an instant he could escape from the prison walls of this faith, his "self consciousness" would be immediately destroyed. It is even a difficult thing for him to admit to himself that the insect or the bird perceives an entirely different world from the one that man does, and that the question of which of these perceptions of the world is the more correct one is quite meaningless, for this would have to have been decided previously in accordance with the criterion of the correct perception, which means, in accordance with a criterion which is not available. But in any case it seems to me that "the correct perception" -- which would mean "the adequate expression of an object in the subject" -- is a contradictory impossibility...

> But when the same image has been generated millions of times and has been handed down for many generations and finally appears on the same occasion every time for all mankind, then it acquires at last the same meaning for men it would have if it were the sole necessary image and if the relationship of the original nerve stimulus to the generated image were a strictly causal one. In the same manner, an eternally repeated dream would certainly be felt and judged to be reality. But the hardening and congealing of a metaphor guarantees absolutely nothing concerning its necessity and exclusive justification...

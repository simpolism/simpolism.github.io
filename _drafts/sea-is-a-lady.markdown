What should a music review be? I'm not trying to sell you anything, might as well link the album in its entirety: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A59T-qgHqyc

Ok, great. Next question: what the hell am I listening to? Hear those vocals coming in, finding their way into your heart? Those are the only ones your getting for the entire album. We're instrumental, baby.

## I

"Well, this is pretty 80s sounding." No shit. Where's it from (Japan, but this is not the CITY POP post you're looking for), when's it from (1987), and who's Toshiki Kadomatsu (good question)? Far as I can tell, Kadomatsu put out a series of 80s pop classics in Japan, starting from "SEA BREEZE" in 1981, with a highlight in 1985's "GOLD DIGGER ~with true love~" (fig 1) (check out "Tokyo Tower" for your next American Psycho theme party banger). Kadomatsu plays guitar and sings, and a team of top notch studio musicians do the rest. _Nice_.

So, what's here? If you're looking for singalongs, definitely nothing. If you're looking for jazz licks, you might find something, but nothing you can't find in a Larry Carlton compilation CD (in particular, "Sunset of Micro Beach 'Satoko'" reminds me of Carlton's mid-80s Christian phase). We'll have to look deeper. And by deeper, I mean we have to look to the part of your fancy new digital synth manual where it says how to trigger the demo songs, because who do you think writes those demos as a side gig? (Probably not Kadomatsu, but perhaps one of his studio musicians, and even then I have no proof, except noting Japan's vertically integrated corporate structure and applying a little bit of reasoning...)

You're telling me that this album is great...because it sounds like a collection of 80s synthesizer demos? Sure, why not! These are some top-notch classically trained musicians. Every single track is unbelievably tight, note-for-note, even the tracks trying to be "funky" manage to come out sounding mechanical, the solos precisely improvised, the bass tightly slapped.

And what if that's good? How novel is it, in the age of DIY, low production quality, every-man-is-a-shitty-vaporwave-producer, to hear an album with this level of _production quality_. The album immediately comes across as alien, as something out of a TV commercial, something worth derision, but we can't quite say why other than "well, it feels a bit stiff and 80s." Perhaps that makes it worth analysis. Maybe we can stumble into some new aesthetic territory, maybe there's some essential quality of music that can only be achieved through stiff perfection... let's listen carefully and find out.

Let's brush away our teenage fashion negs and ask again: what the hell are we listening to? How can we listen past those 80s tropes and discover what this album is about, if anything?

We can use a concept known as "fit". Gabe Duquette says:

> In her excellent essay “Beauty Is Fit”, Sarah Perry redefines beauty as indicating a successful problem-solving strategy, saying it “has a unifying, definitive feature: it reflects the detection of fit between parts of a system.”

> I’ve noticed two basic varieties of fit: aesthetic fit, which I call chords, and abstraction fit, which I call maps...

> Chords are elements combined in a way that is appealing, but not because the combination describes reality. Chords exploit the many evolved sweet spots of the senses. They can be comprised of “real” things but prioritize creation of an experience over transmission of knowledge. Chords can be consonant or dissonant — the sum of their parts can elicit pleasure or irritation, or even revulsion. Chocolate and peanut butter fit better than chocolate and ketchup.

> Maps describe what exists. They exploit the evolved need to understand how reality behaves. They can be aesthetically pleasing but they put the task of abstraction first. Maps “fit” when they achieve compression — when they eliminate redundancies in a pattern of real-world relationships without sacrificing essential features... The Wire fits better than unedited surveillance camera footage or CSI: Miami.

Paraphrased: "fit" means the elements work together. "Chord fit" means they work together to resonate emotionally. "Map fit" means they work together to teach you a meaningful lesson about reality.

Let's start with the latter: does SEA IS A LADY perform any abstraction work whatsoever, does it help you engage with anything real? I'd say not, unless you count its unintentional summary of key 1980s musical tropes. Oh well, music is _a feeling_, man, not some kinda classroom experience. So let's skip to chord fit.

What kind of "chords" might we fit this album into? Some words that come to mind are "urban" "summertime" "beach" (no shit, the album's called _SEA_ IS A LADY)...
